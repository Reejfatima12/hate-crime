HATE CRIME ANALYSIS USA
This project is all about understanding hate crime data in the United States between 2013 and 2023. The main goal is to clean up the dataset, explore it, and find meaningful patterns — like who the offenders are, who the victims are, what kinds of biases are involved, and where these crimes happen. To keep the analysis focused, I only worked with data from those ten years.

I used Python for the analysis, along with libraries like Pandas and NumPy to organize the data, Seaborn and Matplotlib to create graphs and charts, and Scikit-learn for preparing the data in case we want to build machine learning models later. The first step was loading the data and taking a quick look at it using simple commands like head(), info(), and describe(). Then, I cleaned the data by filtering it for the right years, handling missing values (like filling in missing offender race information with "Unknown"), and removing any duplicate entries to make sure the data was accurate.

Once the data was clean, I explored it further — looking at how hate crimes changed over the years, and how different races, places, and other factors were involved. I created visualizations to better spot trends and patterns. Right now, the notebook mainly focuses on getting the data ready and exploring it, but there’s room to add things like machine learning models later to predict or classify hate crime trends.

If you want to run the project yourself, you just need to install a few Python libraries, open the notebook in Jupyter, and run the cells one by one. At this point, the project has a strong base with cleaned and explored data, making it easy to build on it with more advanced analysis in the future. The data likely comes from FBI Hate Crime Statistics or a similar source.
